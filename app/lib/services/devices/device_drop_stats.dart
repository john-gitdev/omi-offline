/// Snapshot of the firmware's SD-write drop counters, read from the
/// 0x19B10062 diagnostics characteristic.
///
/// `blockDrops`: 440-byte storage blocks the SD queue rejected (each ~5 Opus
/// frames / ~100 ms audio).
/// `streamFrameDrops`: individual audio frames dropped in write_to_file()
/// when the SD msgq saturated (typically during card-internal stalls).
/// `bootFrameDrops`: frames lost during the SD mount/boot window.
/// `lastBlockDropUptimeMs`: firmware uptime at the most recent block drop
/// (0 = none since boot).
/// `currentUptimeMs`: firmware uptime at the moment of the read — used to
/// render "X ago" without trusting the phone clock.
///
/// `failedConnCount` / `lastFailedConnDuringSlowAdv`: cumulative BLE
/// connection-establishment failures (HCI 0x3e), persisted across reboots so the
/// count survives the power-cycle the user must do to reconnect and read it.
/// Appended to the characteristic at offset 20 — 0 / false on older firmware
/// that returns only the legacy 20 bytes. See NOTES.md "BLE: advertising but
/// won't connect".
